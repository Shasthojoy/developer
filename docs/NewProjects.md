# New Projects

This document outlines the process for creating new Open Health Care projects.

This is a living document that will change over time.

## Source Code

Source code should be published in a Git repository under the `openhealthcare` GitHub organization.

We try to use repository names that match `/[a-z-]+/` where possible.

If it's a website, we use the domain of the site as the repository name 
(e.g [openhealthcare.org.uk](https://github.com/openhealthcare/openhealthcare.org.uk))

## New Project Checklist

Projects must have the following things

### LICENSE

We default to GPL3 unless there's a good reason not to.

### README

Even if it's just a couple of lines explaining what this is going to _become_, we need some sort of README.

###Â Code of Conduct

Every project we run should have a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. 

You can grab a copy from this repository.

### New Project Shouldlist

Projects should have the following things

* Travis
* Coveralls (For all languages)
* Add to relevant waffle board(s)
* Have a release branch structure in place
