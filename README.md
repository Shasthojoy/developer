The Open Health Care Developer Toolkit aims to provide a standard development environment for all OHC projects.

(It's a Vagrant box with everything you need set up for you!)

## Installation

OK, that sounds neat - what do I do now?

### Step 0. - Prerequisistes

You should  have the following things installed: 

* Virtualbox (https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* Vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com/)
* Python (https://www.python.org/)
* Virtualenv[Wrapper] (http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

```Note: You should make sure that you've set up SSH agent forwarding!
If you've not done this before, running ssh-add will help.```

Got all that? Proceed directly to step 1.

### Step 1. - Bootstrapping

Clone this repository: 

    $ git clone git@github.com:openhealthcare/developer ohcdev

Create yourself a virtualenv for the dev environment: 

    $ cd ohcdev
    $ mkvirtualenv -a $PWD ohcdev

Install the requirements for provisioning your dev environment: 

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the bootstrap script: 

    $ ./bin/bootstrap

```Note: if you're running an old version of Vagrant (< 1.6.3), it may not know about the existence of 
named boxes on Vagrant Cloud. Try updating the latest version!```

### Step 2. - Run Something

OK - so the bootstrap script will have created you a VM, installed some development tools onto it, checked out the source code of out projects, installed dependencies, created users, and generally done a whole bunch of lifting for you.

Next step is to log into the VM: 

    $ vagrant ssh

From there you will have some virtual environments for projects set up - activate one of these: 

    $ workon elcid

This will activate the correct sandbox and take you to the correct working directory for that project. 

Standard development superusers will have been created, so try logging in with super/super1

From here , you can run the service: 

    $ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

The vagrant box will forward this port - so you should be able to now visit http://localhost:8000 and see a running version of the project. 


TODO: Run the tests

### Step 3. 

There is no step 3. 

## What now?

This process has created a stable, automated development environment for you!

The source code for projects is located in /usr/lib/ohc/... in the vagrant box, which is mounted to ./src on your guest. 

More specific documentation about each individual project should be available from it's source code or documentation site.

## Development Workflow

All of our projects are Code-In-The-Open, with governance conducted on public mailing lists and a record of issues/responses available on the web.

In practice, this means that we have a google group and a github repository.

The workflow for OHC projects is broadly as follows: 

### Issue

Issues are created on a public bug tracker, either by developers for technical issues, end users, or Some Other Interested Party

Issues are prioritised & assigned through a process that differs slightly from project to project, but follows some mutation of "Agile". 

c.f. [the elCID Waffle board](https://waffle.io/openhealthcare/elcid)

### Branch, Code & Tests

Work happens in a broadly branch-per-issue manner, except when it doesn't.

All new code && bugfixes should come with appropriate tests, except when they don't.

All new interfaces should come with appropriate documentation, except when they don't.

Use your skill, experience && judgement to figure out when the thing you're doing is exceptional ;)

### PR & Review

All code gets reviewed by a technical colleague where possible - so PRs are your friend. Exeptions may apply to "all". 

Pull Requests should ask the following questions: 

* Do these changes meet the User Need?
* Does the code have appropriate documentation after this change is made?
* Are these changes appropriately tested?

### Deploy to test 
As a general rule, we maintain test servers per deployment, and per sprint/major feature set, on some kind of cloud IAAS/PAAS system. Specifics will vary. 

### Sign-off

As a general rule the originator of the issue should sign off that the implementation meets their needs. In practice, use your skill & judgement.
